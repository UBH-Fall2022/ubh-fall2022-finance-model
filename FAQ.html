            What is the 50/30/20 Rule?

    </p>

   <p>
       According to <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp" title = "More Information Here">Investopedia,</a>
       The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.
   </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            50% of your income should be allocated for Paying bills and on essential items needed for survival such as grocery shopping or rent payments.
        </li>

        <li>
            30% of your income can be allocated for non-essential spending such as paying for vacations, buying takeout,etc. This 30% is highly optional.
        </li>

        <li>
            20% of your spending should be allocated to put back into your savings and investment accounts. This portion of money can be used to either invest in the
            stock market or be placed into a retirement fund. It just ensures that sometime in the future, should something bad happen, you will have a safety net to fall
            back on.
        </li>

            Why did we pick the 50/30/20 Rule?
        </b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            When going through our financial difficulties, we stumbled upon the 50/30/20 rule. After reading, we felt this was the best idea of being able to be
            financially responsible. Having to force ourselves to save 50% of our money into essential spending and the rest for investment really allowed us to
            save money in situations where we may have spent money.
        </li>
    </ul>

            Why did we create FisionTech?
        </b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The reasons for creating Fisiontech are quite personal. As college students, we have been in situations where we impulse buy items we
            have no use for. The feeling of being free to do what you want with your money was a reason why we spent more than we needed to. After reading the 50/30/20 rule
            and applying it to our life, we started spending less, saving more and investing into stocks. FisionTech allows us to use our past experiences to spread awareness
            about having knowledge on financial literacy and being responsible with money.

            My current situation sounds a lot like what you all went through, what should I do?
        </b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The answer is quite clear. <b>START SAVING</b>. All it takes is to start and once you start saving and investing.
            you'll start to notice that the feeling of dread that comes with wasting money will fade away.
