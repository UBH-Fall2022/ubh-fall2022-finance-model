            <b>What is the 50/30/20 Rule????</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            According to <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp">Investopedia,</a>
            The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.
        </p>


        <ul>
            <li>
                50% of your income should be allocated for Paying bills and on essential items needed for survival such as grocery shopping or rent payments.
            </li>
            <li>
                30% of your income can be allocated for non-essential spending such as paying for vacations, buying takeout,etc. This 30% is highly optional.
            </li>
            <li>
                20% of your spending should be allocated to put back into your savings and investment accounts. Examples include placing money into the Stock Market or future
                bill payments. The 20% ensures that in the future, should something bad happen, you will still have a safety net to rely on.
            </li>
        </ul>
